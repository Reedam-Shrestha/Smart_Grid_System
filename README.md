MLPC Project Notebooks & Datasets

Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and supporting datasets for parts 2, 3, and 4 of the MLPC (Machine Learning and Predictive Coding) project. These notebooks walk through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights using machine learning techniques applied to energy distribution and network analysis.

Contents
Notebooks
- `MLPC_part_2.ipynb`: Covers feature selection, data preprocessing, and transformation.
- `Part_3_and_4.ipynb`: Focuses on model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

Datasets
- `demand_peak.csv`: Contains hourly or daily energy demand data during peak usage periods.
- `network_topology (2).csv`: Describes the structure of the energy distribution network, including node connections.
- `source_capacity_peak.csv`: Lists generation source capacities and peak output capabilities.

Requirements
To run these notebooks, make sure you have the following:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
- Required libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
